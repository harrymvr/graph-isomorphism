      "# Finding an isomorphism between unlabeled graphs\n",
      "\n",
      "### Problem definition\n",
      "Given two anonymized versions of a graph $G=(V,E)$, an interesting problem is to find the true mapping between the nodes of these two graphs. Generally, these two anonymized graphs could also have a slightly different set of edges (assume for example that they are the connections of a set of people in two different online social networks)\n",
      "\n",
      "This problem can be formulated as follows:\n",
      ">Given two graphs, $G_1  = (V,E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V,E_2)$ of size $n=|V|$, a \n",
      ">permutation $\\pi$ on $V$ maps the vertices from $G_1$ onto those in $G_2$. \n",
      ">\n",
      ">Find the \u201cbest\u201d such permutation, denoted by $\\pi_0$.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Measuring the error in a solution\n",
      "The cost of a permutation can be expressed in many different ways. One such measure is the **edge-inconsistency** between two graphs, $G_1$ and $G_2$ _[Pedarsani2011]_. This represents the number of edges that exist in one graph and not the other, under a matching $\\pi$. \\begin{equation} \\Delta_{\\pi} = \\sum_{e \\in E_1} \\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\pi(e) \\not\\in E_2\\}} + \\sum_{e \\in E_2} \\mathbb{1}_{\\{\\pi^{-1}(e) \\not\\in E_1\\}}                \\end{equation} Here $\\mathbb{1}_{\\{ A \\}}$ denotes the indicator function, and  $\\pi(e)$ denotes the mapped version of edge $e = (u,v)$, i.e.  $\\pi(e) = (\\pi(u), \\pi(v))$.\n"
